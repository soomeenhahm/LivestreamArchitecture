Workshop Description:
Key Words: Unity, AI, Game, Social Media, Real-time
Required Skills: intermediate to advanced coding knowledge, basic to intermediate knowledge in game engine 
Required Software:  Unity 2019 or up
Required Hardware: Lab top with Windows system
Course Type: Project

In this workshop participants will be using a game engine to develop an interactive project controlled by real-time social media. Machine learning tools will be explored for interpreting collective text from social media into three-dimensional form. Specific generative algorithms and sophisticated server controlled game development pipeline will be introduced during the workshop. The workshop will be taught with intensive computational skillsets which require participants with full-time and high-commitment involvement during the entire workshop period to develop a holistic and intensive team project.

 //Abstract: In this workshop participants will be using a game engine to develop an interactive project controlled by real-time social media. Machine learning tools will be explored for interpreting collective text from social media into three-dimensional form. Specific generative algorithms and sophisticated server controlled game development pipeline will be introduced during the workshop. The workshop will be taught with intensive computational skillsets which require participants with full-time and high-commitment involvement during the entire workshop period to develop a holistic and intensive team project.    

 //Organization: The workshop will be taught via an online meeting platform by three instructors from SCI-Arc. There will be 4 hours of intensive workshop tutorials each day followed by daily project development assignments. We highly recommend only those participants who are interested in developing their coding and computational skills to participate in the preparation of being able to handle intense and focused learning and production routine. Any previous knowledge in coding and game engine is not required but highly appreciated.   

// Daily Schedule: 
Day01 Introduction to Unity + C# Basics +Scene Setup + Installation of plug-ins  
Day02 Language-based neural networks with Tensorflow + Social media APIs   
Day03 Linking Python Servers with Unity and Social Media Platforms, Text based Animated Commands in Unity  
Day04 Interface Design, menu’s and cameras in Unity 
Day05 Interface Design, shaders and lighting in Unity  
Day06 Building and testing applications 

//Expected Outcome: An interactive game which generates virtual urban/architectural environment in real-time controlled by remote multi-users via social media. Relevant documentation such as presentation slides and videos explaining the development process as well as the final game project.

About the Instructors:

Soomeen Hahm is founder of SoomeenHahm Design Ltd - a London based design studio focusing on design research and practice tackling the issues of computational paradigm in architecture across multiple scales and perspectives. The research looks at the ecology of computational power, technology, and human intuition and sees how this collaboration impacts on the design industry and physical environment. Approached from strong academic drives, the office is trying to bridge between academic interests and commercial practices. Currently, the office is interested in the use of Augmentation (ie AR/VR) to execute complex and precise digitally generated forms. Questioning the future role of humans, robots, machines, and computers in design and construction.

M. Casey Rehm is a multidisciplinary designer and founding partner in Ishida Rehm Studio, in Los Angeles, CA. He teaches at The Southern California Institute of Architecture where he is the coordinator for the Masters of Science in Architectural Technology post-professional program. He received his BARCH from Carnegie Mellon University in 2005 and his MSAAD from Columbia University in 2009.  He has professional experience working in offices in Los Angeles, New York, Berlin, and London on a range of projects from low-income residential to large cultural projects. 

Damjan Jovanovic is an architect, educator and software designer, based in Los Angeles. He currently works as Full-Time faculty at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc). Damjan finished the post-graduate Master of Arts in Architecture degree at the Städelschule in Frankfurt, Germany in 2014, where he afterwards worked as design faculty. Damjan’s work centers on the development of experimental architectural software, and his interests lie in investigating the culture and aesthetics of software platforms, as well as questions of contemporary architectural education, authorship and creativity.
